   <h1>Why WAMP?</h1>

   <p>
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">The WebSocket Protocol</a>
      is already built into modern browsers and provides bidirectional,
      low-latency message-based communication.
      However, as such, WebSocket it is quite low-level and only provides raw
      messaging.

   <p>
      Modern Web applications often have a need for <strong>higher level messaging patterns</strong>
      such as
   </p>

   <ul>
      <li><strong>Publish & Subscribe</strong> (PubSub)</li>
      <li><strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (RPC)</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
      This is where <i>The WebSocket Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)</i> enters.
      WAMP adds the higher level messaging patterns of RPC and PubSub to WebSocket.
   </p>

   <p>
      Technically, WAMP is a <strong>proper WebSocket subprotocol</strong> (runs on top of WebSocket)
      that uses <strong>JSON</strong> as message serialization format.
   </p>

   <p>
      WAMP embraces open Web standards and was designed to be easy to use and
      simple to implement.
