   <h2>What is the legal status of WAMP?</h2>
   <p>
      WAMP is free - both as in beer and as in speech. Do with it what you like.
      If WAMP fills your needs as it is, then the easiest thing is to just use it
      without any changes. The more compatible implementations, the better for
      interoperability. If your needs require modifications, or you want to start your
      own development based on WAMP, then you are also free to do so.<br>
      Whatever you do with WAMP - an announcement on the mailing list is always
      welcome.
   </p>

   <h2>Are there any requirements if I use WAMP for my project?</h2>
   <p>
      WAMP is free to use for anybody, be it as part of an open source or a
      commercial project. There are no strings attached here, no licenses to
      pay, and no known other intellectual property (such as patents).<br>
      If you do use WAMP for your project, then both a mention of this somewhere
      in your project, and an announcement on the mailing list would be welcome.
   </p>

   <h2>Why is WAMP trademarked?</h2>
   <p>
      The WAMP word- and desing mark are trademarked as a way to ensure that only
      proper use is made of them. This is especially the case in regard to assurances
      regarding compatibility. A trademark policy detailing correct use is in the works.
      For now, and for a quick overview of the base principles of the trademark
      policy, see the following question.
   </p>

   <h2>Who can use the WAMP word mark or the WAMP design mark?</h2>
   <p>
      The fact that WAMP is a word mark does not prevent factual use. If you e.g.
      announced that you were working on a WAMP implementation, or discussed details
      of your implementation work, or recommended this website, these are all,
      naturaly, entirely unproblematic uses.<br>
      For any use of the word mark which could imply a direct endorsement, or other
      official connection with the WAMP project, or when in doubt, please contact Tavendo.
      The same goes for any use of the design mark (i.e. the WAMP logo at the top of
      the project page).<br>
      We will take a look as quickly as possible, and try to arrange a license if this should be
      necessary. (And a license does not need to be a big deal.)
   </p>

   <h2>What does the CC copyright on this website mean?</h2>
   <p>
      The threshold for using WAMP should be as low as possible. This includes
      the documentation for what you are doing. The CC BY license
      simply means that you are free to use any materials on this website (with
      the exception of the WAMP word mark or WAMP design mark) for your project.
      You can copy & paste or edit anything you think useful to for e.g. your own project
      website or your documentation. This applies irrespective of whether your
      project is commercial or non-commercial.<br>
      The only requirement is that you attribute this use. In an internet context,
      this is most easily done by providing something like 'some materials copied/adapted
      from' + a link to the WAMP website.
   </p>

   <h2>Why does WAMP use URIs to identify RPC endpoints and PubSub topics?</h2><a name="why_uris"></a>
   <p>
      The benefits of using URIs (from the HTTP scheme) are:
      <ul>
         <li>well known hierarchical naming scheme</li>
         <li>an established global name registry / arbitration system (DNS)</li>
         <li>by virtue of the first two, ability to integrate apps from different vendors without naming conflicts</li>
         <li>as a potential feature in the future: have the ability to make those URIs derefencable for obtaining metadata</li>
      </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
      URIs are mandatory for topic and procedures. The current AutobahnXX
      implementations don't _yet_ enforce this, but will do so.
   </p>
   <p>
      In your payloads (RPC args, PubSub event payload) you are free do
      to anything of course.
      We (at Tavendo) for our apps use URIs for anything which isn't a literal value,
      that is all ID like things, vocabulary (verbs, adj, ..) describing
      relations between entities .. everything.
