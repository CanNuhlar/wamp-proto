The Web Application Messaging Protocol
======================================

Welcome to the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP).

WAMP is an open standard `WebSocket <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455>`_
`subprotocol <https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml>`_ that provides two 
application messaging patterns in one unified protocol:

* routed **Remote Procedure Calls** and
* **Publish & Subscribe**

Using WAMP you can build distributed systems out of application components which are
loosely coupled and communicate in (soft) real-time.

.. note::

    The WAMP protocol is now a community effort and the specification is made available for
    free under an open license for everyone to use or implement. The original design
    and proposal was created by `Crossbar.io <https://crossbar.io>`_ developers in 2012 and
    is sponsored since then by `Crossbar.io (the company) <https://crossbario.com>`_.
