The Web Application Messaging Protocol
======================================

Welcome to the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP).

WAMP is an open standard WebSocket subprotocol that provides two application messaging
patterns in one unified protocol:

* (routed) **Remote Procedure Calls** and
* **Publish & Subscribe**

Using WAMP you can build distributed systems out of application components which are
loosely coupled and communicate in (soft) real-time.
