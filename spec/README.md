# The Web Application Messaging Protocol

This document specifies the [Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP)](http://wamp-proto.org) split into two parts:

* [The Web Application Messaging Protocol, Part 1: Basic Profile](basic.md)
* [The Web Application Messaging Protocol, Part 2: Advanced Profile](advanced.md)

> Please note that further work on the WAMP Basic Profile has shifted to this [Internet Draft (ID)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-oberstet-hybi-tavendo-wamp-00). We expect to integrate features from the WAMP Advanced Profile into this Internet Draft over time.
