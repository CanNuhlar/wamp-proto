# The Web Application Messaging Protocol

[WAMP](http://wamp.ws) is an open standard WebSocket subprotocol that provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol:

* Remote Procedure Calls and
* Publish & Subscribe

Using WAMP you can build distributed systems out of application components which are loosely coupled and communicate in (soft) real-time.
