# The Web Application Messaging Protocol

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/tavendo/WAMP](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/tavendo/WAMP?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) - [Current Internet Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-oberstet-hybi-tavendo-wamp-00)

[WAMP](http://wamp.ws) is an open standard WebSocket subprotocol that provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol:

* Remote Procedure Calls and
* Publish & Subscribe

Using WAMP you can build distributed systems out of application components which are loosely coupled and communicate in (soft) real-time.

The [WAMP spec](https://github.com/tavendo/WAMP/tree/master/spec) is a community effort and the spec is made available for free under an [open license](LEGAL.md) for everyone to use or implement.

[WAMP implementations](http://wamp.ws/implementations/) are available for many different languages and run-time environments.

Find out more on the [Web site](http://wamp.ws) or get in touch on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/wampws).
