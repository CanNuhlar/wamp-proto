[WAMP](http://wamp-proto.org) is an open standard WebSocket subprotocol that provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol:

* Remote Procedure Calls and
* Publish & Subscribe

Using WAMP you can build distributed systems out of application components which are loosely coupled and communicate in (soft) real-time.

The [WAMP spec](https://github.com/wamp-proto/wamp-proto/blob/master/spec/) is a community effort and the spec is made available for free under an [open license](LEGAL.md) for everyone to use or implement.

[WAMP implementations](http://wamp-proto.org/implementations/) are available for many different languages and run-time environments.

Find out more on the [Web site](http://wamp-proto.org) or get in touch on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/wampws).

## Standardization of WAMP as an IETF standard

We're currently working on getting WAMP onto a the IETF standards track. 

Your participation here is highly welcome!

The current state of both the RFC and the protocol definition is summarized in [rfc/STATUS.md](rfc/STATUS.md) which also links to the individual parts of the spec.
